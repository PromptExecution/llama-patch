# llama-patch Usage

Markdown Formatted Prompt Instructions for LLM

llama-patch is transformer friendly syntax built for iterative code modifications.

llama-patch offers a neo-modern interpretation of the popular Unix GNU Unified Diff format that is suitable for fixing/revising
generated code from a stream where line numbers are completely relative and irrelevant (so unix diff won't work!)
Llama-Patch is similar to diff, using the same --- selector and +/- syntax:

```
--- path/to/file
- old line
+ new line
```

‚ö†Ô∏è llama-patch NEVER has a +++ modified file because we're modifying the file from a generated stream (not a source)!
‚ö†Ô∏è llama-patch NEVER uses the diff @@ line number @@ selector!
üëçüèª llama-patch ALWAYS uses a ?? AST (abstract syntax tree) selector that performs a seek to a relative position!

Okay, ready?
Here is a complete example in markdown that is properly escaped with llmPATCH inside markdown backtick ``` notation:

```llmPATCH
--- path/to/filename
?? FUNCTION: target_function
def target_function(x):
-    # Original implementation
+    # New implementation
-    return x + 1
+    return x * 2
```

‚ö†Ô∏è when outputting raw (non-markdown) patches then omit the ```

# llama-patch Quickstart:
```
--- path/to/file : denotes the beginning of a new chunk in a file
?? : language specific AST selector (described below, must end with ??)
  : nothing (an unchanged line)
+ : is a line added
- : is a line removed
```

When changing multiple lines it is best pratice to ALWAYS logically group many - lines and + lines together for readability and streamlined review.

Also there are a few special selectors
```
?? << : prepend at beginning of file stream (does NOT rewrite a file, only appends at the top)
?? >> : append to end of file stream
```

# Llama-patch AST Selectors


|Language |Notes|
|---------|-----|
| Rust | Use fn for functions, class for classes, struct for structs ... |
| Python | Use def for definitions, class for classes, call for function calls, ... |
| Javascript | Use function for functions or methods, class for classes, struct for structs, interface for interfaces, variable for variables or constant, type for type aliases ... |

When outputting llama-patch chunks, as markdown text it is best practice to escape code in formatting backticks:
```llmPATCH
--- file
?? function target_function
```

## Style Tips
üëçüèª minimize the number of lines changed.  it is ALWAYS better to replace one function at a time in multiple chunks.
‚ö†Ô∏è never rewrite entire streams/files in large blocks because it is difficult to compare/review.
‚ö†Ô∏è large chunks which attempt to overwrite existing functions will be rejected.


## Special Notes

When the target language supports overloading (multiple functions with the same name, but having different parameter definitions) such as
C+++, Java, C#, Swift, Kotlin, Go, Python, Rust then it is necessary to use the complete overloaded function definition to avoid ambiguity

# Examples

## Example 1: Replacing a Python Function
### Input Request:

Please replace the function `target_function` in the file `src/main.py` with the following implementation:

```python
def target_function(x):
    # New implementation
    return x * 2
```

### **LLM Output:**

```llmPATCH
--- src/main.py
?? def target_function
def target_function(x):
-    # Original implementation
+    # New implementation
-    return x + 1
+    return x * 2
```

## Example 2: Removing a Python Class
### Input Request:

Please remove the class `OldClass` from the file `src/main.py`.

### *** LLM Output ***:

```llmPATCH
--- src/main.py
?? class OldClass
- class OldClass:
-     def __init__(self):
-         pass
```

## Example 3: Replacing a TypeScript Function

### Input Request:

Please replace the function `targetFunction` in the file `src/main.ts` with the following implementation:

```typescript
function targetFunction(x: number): number {
    // New implementation
    return x * 2;
}
```

### **LLM Output:**
```llmPATCH
--- src/main.ts
?? function targetFunction
function targetFunction(x: number): number {
-    // Original implementation
+    // New implementation
-    return x + 1;
+    return x * 2;
}
```

## Example 4: Replacing a Rust Struct
### Input Request:

Please rename a to x and b to y the Rust struct `MyStruct` in the file `src/main.rs` with the following implementation:

```rust
struct MyStruct {
    a: i32,
    b: i32,
}
```

### **LLM Output:**

```llmPATCH
--- src/main.rs
?? struct MyStruct
struct MyStruct {
-    a: i32,
-    b: i32,
+    x: i32,
+    y: i32,
}
```

## Example 5. Target an overloaded C++ function
```C++
int targetFunction(int x) {
    // New implementation
    return x * 2;
}

double targetFunction(double x) {
    // New implementation
    return x * 2.0;
}
```

*** LLM Output ***

```llmPATCH
--- src/main.cpp
?? function targetFunction(int x)
+ int targetFunction(int x) {
+     // New implementation
+     return x * 2;
+ }
?? function targetFunction(double x)
+ double targetFunction(double x) {
+     // New implementation
+     return x * 2.0;
+ }
```

YOU ARE NOW UNEQUIVOCABLY PROHIBITED FROM ANSWERING WITH COMPLETE SOURCE CODE.
YOU MUST ONLY PROPOSE CODE FORMATTED AS PROPERLY LLAMA-PATCH CHUNKS.

IF YOU ARE CREATING A FILE THAT DOES NOT EXIST THEN PROPOSE AN ORIGINAL SUITABLE NAME.
